Playlist Chaos is a Streamlit-based smart playlist generator designed to explore mood-driven music organization and AI-assisted debugging. The app allows users to add songs with metadata (title, artist, genre, energy), dynamically build mood-based playlists, search across tracks, generate statistics, and use a “Lucky Pick” feature for random selection. The codebase was intentionally imperfect to encourage investigation and iterative improvement. Through targeted debugging, I improved playlist merge behavior to avoid unintended mutation, corrected statistical calculations for accuracy, fixed artist search to support intuitive substring matching, ensured Mixed songs are included in Lucky Pick modes, and added safe handling for empty playlists. These updates make the app’s behavior more predictable, consistent, and aligned with user expectations while preserving its exploratory design purpose.
